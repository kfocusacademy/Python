Find gradient descent for the below data pointers

no_of_test = 1,2,3,4,5
test_score = 60,65,70,75,80

Compare m and b (from Gradient Descent) with linear regression model (Hint reg.coef_ and reg.interceptor_)
Also draw a Linear graph for both predicted test and test score value (Hint: use reg.predict method)
